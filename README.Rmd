## kasper: another safety providing evaluator in R <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" />


`r badge_lifecycle("experimental")`
`r badge_custom("language", "R", "blue", "https://cran.r-project.org/")`
`r badge_github_version("GregorDeCillia/kasper", "red")`
`r badge_code_size("GregorDeCillia/kasper")`

This package allows to safely evaluate strings in R using something more sophisticated than

```{r, eval = FALSE}
code <- "x <- 1"
eval(parse(text = code))
```

by applying a whitelisting logic. The "whitelist" contains
safe commands which won't be able to hurt your system when
the `code` is sent by a client. This package was developed for usage in a shiny
web application that aims to give users access to an editor where they can 
execute R scripts on a server. In order to secure the server, this package is supposed to be used in the future.

### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## install from github
devtools::install_github("GregorDeCillia/kasper")
```

### Usage

Create a new evaluator with `evaluator$new()`. This will initialize a new evaluator
object.

```{r}
library(kasper)
myEvaluator <- evaluator$new()
```

The evaluator object has a method `eval()`, which evaluates R code passed as a string or as an expression.

```{r}
myEvaluator$eval({
  x <- 1; x <- x + 1; x; x - 1
})
```

There are no outputs? Don't worry they are all captured in the `myEvaluator` object and can be retrieved with `replay()`. The method is named after the underlying function `evaluate::replay` which was developed by the `r-lib` organization.

```{r}
myEvaluator$replay()
```

If your R code contains any errors, error messages will be returned by the `replay()` method. This does not interrupt the evaluation.

### Error handling

Errors are just part of the output for the `replay()` function. They will
not interrupt the evaluation.

```{r}
myEvaluator$eval({ y; 2 + 2 })
myEvaluator$replay()
```

### The whitelist

An error also occurs if the user try to perform anything that is not 
whitelisted. Functions like `system()` are not available and trated as though they do not exist.

```{r}
myEvaluator$eval("system('mkdir testdir')")
myEvaluator$replay()
```

To display all whitelisted commands, use `getWhiteList()`.

```{r}
head(myEvaluator$getWhiteList())
```

### dplyr

The evaluator can add minimal support for `dplyr` operations by setting the
`dplyr` flag to `TRUE` after loading the package

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
myEvaluator <- evaluator$new(dplyr = TRUE)
myEvaluator$eval({
  data.frame(a = 1:4, b = letters[1:4]) %>% filter(a < 3)
})
myEvaluator$replay()
```
