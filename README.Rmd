## kaspeR: a*nother* s*afety* p*roviding* e*valuator* *in* R <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" />


`r badge_lifecycle("experimental")`
`r badge_custom("language", "R", "blue", "https://cran.r-project.org/")`

This package allows to safely evaluate strings in R using something more sophisticated than

```{r, eval = FALSE}
code <- "x <- 1"
eval(parse(text = code))
```

by applying a whitelisting logic. The "whitelist" contains
safe commands which won't be able to hurt your system when
the `code` is sent by a client.

### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## install from github
devtools::install_github("GregorDeCillia/kaspeR")
```

### Usage

Create a new evaluator with the `new()` method.

```{r}
library(kaspeR)
myEvaluator <- evaluator$new()
```

Evaluate strings with the `eval()` method.

```{r}
myEvaluator$eval("
x <- 1
x <- x + 1
x
x - 1
")
```

No outputs? Don't worry they are all captured in the `myEvaluator` object.

```{r}
myEvaluator$replay()
```

### Error handling

Errors are just part of the output for the repay function. They will
not interrupt the evaluation.

```{r}
myEvaluator$eval("
y
2 + 2
")
myEvaluator$replay()
```

### The whitelist

An error also occurs if the user try to perform anything that is not 
whitelisted. Functions like `system()` are not available and trated as though they do not exist.

```{r}
myEvaluator$eval("system('mkdir testdir')")
myEvaluator$replay()
```

To display all whitelisted commands, use `getWhiteList()`.

```{r}
myEvaluator$getWhiteList()
```
